# Book Collection Backend
MongoDB backend for the Book Collection application.

## Usage
The project assumes you have a MongoDB instance installed locally on your computer. If it's installed elsewhere, edit the `dbName` and `url` strings located in `/routes/books.js` file.

To start the server, assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, navigate to the project directory in command line/terminal and type the following commands.

```
npm install
npm start
```
The server is now running on *http://localhost:3000*.
